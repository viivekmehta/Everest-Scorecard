2) Once you click on submit, you will be redirected to the scorecard page where you will be selecting the "Ball Type", "Shot" and "Shot Timing" for each ball of the match. All the information, such as: Score, wickets, total overs, innings, which team won the toss and selected what, etc. will also be shown in this page.

# What if a match is tied

Yes, you guessed it right! It's time for a super over.

1) The first inning of the super over will be autoplayed for your convenience.

2) On the auto-completion of the first inning, random 6 bowling cards will be selected and shown in the screen. The total of the first inning will also be calculated randomly in the background and shown to you along with the target. You just have to select the "Shot type" and "Shot timing" for each bowling card.

3) Once any team wins the super over, the result will be popped up with the score information of both the teams as shown below:

# Fun Fact

An audio commentary will be played for each shot you play.

Also, you don't always have to play both the innings and tie the match to play the super over. You also have an option in the homepage where you can directly selec the "Overs" as "1 (Super Over)" to directly play the super over match.

Have fun and let the game begin ✌️
